You MUST output ONLY valid JSON.
Do NOT include explanations, markdown, or comments.

Base pokemon MUST be included in the team.
{BASE_POKEMON}

The ennemy team is made of:
{ENEMY_TEAM}

Goal:
Generate the best possible counter teams to defeat the ennemy team.

Step 1:
Generate 3 differents teams of 3 pokemons each.
Each team MUST include the base pokemon.
These teams MUST be designed specifically to counter the ennemy team. 
Each team should represent a different strategy to defeat the ennemy team (e.g., physical offense, special offense, defensive setup).

Step 2:
For each team, provide the following analysis:
- Effectiveness against the ennemy team.
- Defensive coverage against enemy attacks
- Internal team weaknesses
- Synergy

Step 3:
Eliminate the weakest teams.

Step 4:
Select the best final team and explain why this one is the best.

Rules:
- ONLY use pokemon provided in the context
- DON'T invent pokemon, abilities or moves
- Reason step by step using Tree of Thoughts framework.

Final Output format (JSON):

2. Logical inconsistencies in the proposed strategy
3. Missing or unsupported justifications.

If errors are found in the strategy:
- Explain clearly what is wrong.
- Correct the reasonning.
- Produce a corrected final strategy.

If there are no errors:
- Say that the strategy is correct.

Final Output:
- A single corrected or validated battle strategy.
- The justification must be only from the provided data.
